Off with the big news, everyone. Hyperloot is launching its bounty campaign. In case you lived under a crypto rock, just a few brief points about this project. Hyperloot integrates gaming with blockchain to introduce a new concept of ownership in gaming, let users tokenize their virtual assets and trade them freely. We’ve already deployed a wallet MVP and launched a viable tokenization prototype. New developments are underway, and we need your support and proactive participation to grow and expand our community and to build a starting market for our native HLT token.

The goal of the bounty campaign is to raise awareness about our activities and mission. We don’t go to ICO or pre-mine, so everyone willing to help out will have an equal opportunity to join and get rewarded.
