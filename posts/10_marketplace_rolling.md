It’s time for our favorite – product announcements!

We’re coming to a close on testing and opening up a beta for our marketplace!

Hyperloot and Esportbits set out toa chieve an ambitious goal - leading gaming market into a new era and accelerating blockchain adoption. 
Over time, we’ve developed a set of tool sot help us get there faster. 

One of them is Lootmart –  it a simplified auction that is powered by Esportbits. What does it do? Makes our token real and useful. 
LootMart is our own solution for creating a decentralized marketplace centered around our token.  
Think of it as an eBay that lets you pay our tokens for any gaming-related item out there. 
It allows for a fiat-token turnover with price discovery of items relative to our token. 

Lootmart features:
*          Liquidity sharing across our partner network
*         Familiar auction-like trading experience
*          Price discovery or illiquid digital assets
*          Games, merchandise and gaming items sold directly in HLT

Simply put - buy real items with HLT!

We are currently developing a direct fiat on-ramp that will let you convert HLT into USD directly through Lootmart with our top-of-the-line partner including bank-grade security and blazing fast transactions!

It’s a great way to start using those bounty tokens if yous till got them! If not - you can get some soon enough or go to one to the exchanges and buy them. 
All of the items emitted using Esportbits will be available on Lootmart!
