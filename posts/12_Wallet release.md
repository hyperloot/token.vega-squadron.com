Hey everyone, 

We have just shipped our mobile-first crypto-wallet for gamers and their assets - Lootmart Wallet! 

Your collectibles are available right away in the app, no need to manually search for your tokens. 

Send crypto to your friends, share your collectibles or other in-game inventory stuff. 
We have full support of ERC-20 and ERC-721 which means the wallet is totally ready for your coins and kitties. 

The first version of the app is available on the AppStore. Enjoy your adventure with us!
