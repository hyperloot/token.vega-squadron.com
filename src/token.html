            <p>Unlike WAX, ENJIN, FLIP and other “closed-source” exchange tokens, Esportbits provides liquidity in the illiquid long-tail market. Such an approach allows for item airdrop directly to new/prospective consumers reducing user acquisition costs while providing “last mile” of engagement and relationships. Unlike competitors we are the only open source project founded by non-profit association. We are also the only one that provides zero transaction fees and aggregates liquidity by integrating with other market exchanges.</p>
